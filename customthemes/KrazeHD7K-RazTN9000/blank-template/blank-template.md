### Version 1.0

## Description

Add a description of what your theme is all about. This example theme replaces all stock image data and indicates what/where editable regions are present.

This theme pack is part of a larger reverse-engineering project, located at https://github.com/ginbot86/ColorLCDVape-RE. It is intended to:

 - demonstrate how to manipulate the contents of the SPI Flash memory
 - demonstrate how to make custom theme packs that fit within the restrictions of the original firmware
 - showcase the "hackability" of so-called "disposable" vapes
 - offer a level of customization previously unachieved for such devices, as well as how some embedded devices manipulate and display image data
